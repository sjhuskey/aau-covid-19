_The Chronicle of Higher Education_ maintains a [record](https://chronicle.com/blogs/live-coronavirus-updates/heres-a-list-of-colleges-that-will-require-students-to-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19) of all institutions of higher education in the United States of America that have a requirement for employees and/or students to be vaccinated. Since they have made the data openly available, I thought it would be interesting to see what is happening at the institutions that are members of the [Association of American Universities](https://www.aau.edu/). You can view the list of members at <https://www.aau.edu/sites/default/files/AAU-Files/Who-We-Are/AAU-Member-List.pdf>.

I have done this because many institutions aspire to membership in the AAU. If membership in that august body is the goal, then it seems prudent to follow the lead of existing members in as many ways as possible. Making policies regarding COVID-19 mitigation that are based on science, not politics, would be a great place to start.

Here are my findings as of August 24, 2021:

- 70% (46 out of 65 institutions) of AAU institutions report having a requirement for a Covid-19 vaccination.
- 100% of those AAU institutions report that vaccination is **required** for students.
- 83% of those AAU institutions report that vaccination is **required** for employees.
- Most (39) of the AAU institutions with a vaccine requirement are in states that voted for Biden in 2020, but seven were in states that voted for Trump.

It is also worth noting that only one AAU institution (Vanderbilt) in the Big XII and SEC athletic conferences has a requirement for vaccination against COVID-19.

A note on the following table: I downloaded the data from _The Chronicle of Higher Education's_ website, and I compared it with the list of AAU member institutions. I added a column to the _Chronicle's_ data to indicate AAU membership status. The name of the institution is linked to its COVID-19 policy.
